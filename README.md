# Introductory JavaScript Project
## Date: 2023-02-06

This project is my first attempt at working with JavaScript. I completed the introductory JavaScript tutorial on Scrimba to test my skills and gain a better understanding of the language. The tutorial covered the basics of JavaScript and provided hands-on experience with writing and executing code.

This project has given me a strong foundation in JavaScript and I am excited to continue learning and building upon my skills in the future.

If you have any feedback or suggestions for improvements, please don't hesitate to share! I am always looking for ways to grow and develop my skills. Your input would be greatly appreciated.
